{"title": "September 3 1892 Speech Accepting the Republican Nomination-Benjamin Harrison", "content": " new business adjustments. If the change of direction is so radical as to bring the commercial turn-table into use the business changes involved are not readjustments, but reconstructions.\n\nThe Democratic party offers a programme of demolition. The protective policy — to which all business, even that of the importer, is now adjusted — the reciprocity policy, the new merchant marine, are all to be demolished, not gradually, not taken down, but blown up. To this programme of destruction it has added one constructive feature, the reestablishment of State banks of issue.\n\nThe policy of the Republican party is, on the other hand, distinctively a policy of safe progression and development—of new factories, new markets, and new ships. It will subject business to no perilous changes, but offers attractive opportunities for expansion upon familiar lines.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nBEJ. HARRISON.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C.,\n\nSeptember 3, 1892"}
