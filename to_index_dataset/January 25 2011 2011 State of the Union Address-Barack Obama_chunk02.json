{"title": "January 25 2011 2011 State of the Union Address-Barack Obama", "content": " That’s how we win the future.\n\n      We’re a nation that says, “I might not have a lot of money, but I have this great idea for a new company.”  “I might not come from a family of college graduates, but I will be the first to get my degree.”  “I might not know those people in trouble, but I think I can help them, and I need to try.”  “I’m not sure how we’ll reach that better place beyond the horizon, but I know we’ll get there.  I know we will.”\n\n      We do big things.  (Applause.)\n\n      The idea of America endures.  Our destiny remains our choice.  And tonight, more than two centuries later, it’s because of our people that our future is hopeful, our journey goes forward, and the state of our union is strong.\n\n      Thank you.  God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)"}
