{"title": "December 11 1941 Message to Congress Requesting War Declarations with Germany and Italy-Franklin D. Roosevelt", "content": "To the Congress:\n\n On the morning of December eleventh, the Government of Germany, pursuing its course of world conquest, declared war against the United States.\n\n The long known and the long expected has thus taken place. The forces endeavoring to enslave the entire world now are moving toward this hemisphere.\n\n Never before has there been a greater challenge to life, liberty, and civilization.\n\n Delay invites greater danger. Rapid and united effort by all of the peoples of the world who are determined to remain free will insure a world victory of the forces of justice and of righteousness over the forces of savagery and of barbarism.\n\n Italy also has declared war against the United States.\n\n I therefore request the Congress to recognize a state of war between the United States and Germany, and between the United States and Italy."}
