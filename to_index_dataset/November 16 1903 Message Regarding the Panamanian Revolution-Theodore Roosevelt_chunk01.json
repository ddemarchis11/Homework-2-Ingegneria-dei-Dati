In selecting for its first representative at Washington a veteran servant and champion of the Panama Canal, my Government has evidently sought to show that it considers a loyal and earnest devotion to the success of that most heroic conception of human genius as both a solemn duty and the essential purpose of its existence. I congratulate myself, sir, that my first official duty should be to respectfully request you to convey to His Excellency the President of the United States on behalf of the people of Panama an expression of the grateful sense of their obligation to his Government. In extending her generous hand so spontaneously to her latest born, the Mother of the American Nations is prosecuting her noble mission as the liberator and the educator of the peoples. In spreading her protecting wings over the territory of our Republic the American Eagle has sanctified it. It has rescued it from the barbarism of unnecessary and wasteful civil wars to consecrate it to the destiny assigned to it by Providence, the service of humanity and the progress of civilization.\n\nPHILIPPE BUNAU VARILLA.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND THE\n\nUNITED STATES LEGATION AT BOGOTA.\n\nMr. Beaupre to Mr. Hay.\n\n(TELEGRAM)\n\nBOGOTA, November 4, 1903.\n\n(Received November 6, 1903, 5 p.m.)\n\nFourth, 5 p.m. Confidential. I have been shown telegram from reliable source in Panama to the effect that Isthmus is preparing for secession and that proclamation of independence may be expected soon. The particulars carefully guarded. Reliable information hard to obtain. This Government is evidently alarmed and troops are being sent to Isthmus. Repeat telegrams of importance from United States consul-general. His telegrams to me may be interfered with.\n\nBEAUPRE.\n\nMr. Hay to Mr. Beaupre'.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, November 6, 1903.\n\nThe people of Panama having by an apparently unanimous movement dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed their independence, and having adopted a government of their own--republican in form--with which the Government of the United States of America has entered into relations, the President of the United States, in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so long and so happily existed between the respective nations, most earnestly .commends to the Governments of Colombia and of Panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at issue between them.

General Reyes has the perfect confidence of Vice-President, he says, and if it becomes necessary will go to the Isthmus or send representatives there to adjust matters along above lines to the satisfaction of the people there. If he goes he would like to act in harmony with the commander of the United States forces. This is the personal opinion of Reyes, and he will advise this Government to act accordingly. There is a great reaction of public opinion in favor of the treaty, and it is considered certain that the treaty was not legally rejected by Congress. To-morrow martial law will be declared; 1,000 troops will be sent from the Pacific side; about the same number from the Atlantic side. Please answer by telegraph.\n\nBEAUPRE.\n\nMr. Beaupre' to Mr. Hay.\n\n(TELEGRAM)\n\nBOGOTA, November 7, 1903.\n\n(Received November 10, 7:30 p.m.)\n\nNovember 7, 2 p.m. General Reyes leaves next Monday for Panama, invested with full powers. He has telegraphed chiefs of the insurrection that his mission is to the interests of Isthmus. He wishes answer from you, before leaving, to the inquiry in my telegram of yesterday and wishes to know if the American commander will be ordered to co-operate with him and with new Panama Government to arrange peace and the approval of canal treaty, which will be accepted on condition that the integrity of Colombia be preserved. He has telegraphed President of Mexico to ask the Government of the United States and all the countries represented at the Pan-American conference to aid Colombia to preserve her integrity. The question of the approval of the treaty mentioned in my telegram of yesterday will be arranged in Panama. He asks that before taking definite action you will await his arrival there, and that the Government of the United States in the meantime preserve the neutrality and transit of the Isthmus and do not recognize the new Government. Great excitement here. Martial law has been declared in the Cauca and Panama. Answer.\n\nBEAUPRE.\n\nMr. Beaupre' to Mr. Hay.\n\n(TELEGRAM)\n\nBOGOTA, November 7, 1903.\n\n(Received November 10, 7:55 p.m.)\n\nNovember 7, 6 p.m. As the Government of the United States has war vessels at Panama and Colon, minister for foreign affairs has requested me to ask, Will you allow Colombian Government to land troops at those ports to fight there and on the line of railway? Also if the Government of the United States will take action to maintain Colombian right and sovereignty on the Isthmus in accordance with article 35, the treaty of 1846, in case the Colombian Government is entirely unable to suppress the secession movement there ?\n\nI am entirely unable to elicit from minister for foreign affairs confirmation of the promises made by --\n\nBEAUPRE.\n\nMr. Beaupre' to Mr. Hay.\n\n(TELEGRAM)\n\nBOGOTA, November 9, 1903.\n\n(Received November 11, 12:30 a. m.)\n\nNovember 9, 9 a. m. I am desired to inform you by General Reyes that Gen. Bedronel Ospina and Lucas Cabellero, prominent party leaders, accompany him on his mission.\n\nVery great excitement here. Large crowds paraded streets yesterday, crying \"Down with Marroquin.\" Mass meeting denounced him; called for a change of government. Hundreds gathered at the palace, and their orator, a prominent national general, addressed the President, calling for his resignation. Troops dispersed gathering, wounding several. Martial law is declared here, and the city is being guarded by soldiers. Legation of the United States Under strong guard, but apparently no indications of hostile demonstration.\n\nThe residence of Lorenzo Marroquin attacked with stones.\n\nReferring to the questions presented by minister for foreign affairs in my telegram of 7th, I have preserved silence, but bear in mind page 578, Foreign Relations, part 3, 1866, and instructions 134 to minister to the United States of Colombia, 1865.\n\nBEAUPRE.\n\nMr. Hay to Mr. Beaupre'.\n\n(TELEGRAM)\n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, November 11, 1903.\n\n(Sent 12:12 p.m.)\n\nEarnestly desiring an amicable solution of matters at issue between Colombia and Panama, we have instructed our consul-general at Panama to use good offices to secure for General Reyes a courteous reception and considerate hearing. It is not thought desirable to permit landing of Colombian troops on Isthmus, as such a course would precipitate civil war and disturb for an indefinite period the free transit which we are pledged to protect. I telegraphed you on November 6 that we had entered into relations with the provisional government.\n\nHAY.\n\nCORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE\n\nCHARGE' D'AFFAIRES OF COLOMBIA.\n\nMr. Hay to Doctor Herran.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, November 6, 1903\n\nDEAR DOCTOR HERRAN: I inclose Copy of a dispatch which has to-day been sent to our minister at Bogota.\n\nVery sincerely, yours,\n\nJOHN HAY.\n\n(INCLOSURE.)\n\nMr. Hay to Mr. Beaupre'.\n\n(TELEGRAM)\n\nNovember 6, 1903.\n\nBEAUPRE, Bogota:\n\nThe people of Panama having by an apparently unanimous movement dissolved their political connection with the Republic of Colombia and resumed their independence, and having adopted a government of their own, republican in form, with which the Government of the United States of America has entered into relations, the President of the United States, in accordance with the ties of friendship which have so long and so happily existed between the respective nations, most earnestly commends to the governments of Colombia and Panama the peaceful and equitable settlement of all questions at issue between them.

In conversation with minister for foreign affairs he expressed himself in very sympathetic manner. Has authorized French consul at Panama to enter into relations with de facto government. Recognition will no doubt follow in time, and it seems to be disposition of European powers to await formal recognition by the United States before acting.\n\nPORTER.\n\nRECEPTION OF MINISTERS OF PANAMA.\n\nMr. Varilla to Mr. Hay.\n\n(TRANSLATION)\n\nLEGATION OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA,\n\nWashington, November 11, 1903.\n\nMR.

BUNAU VARILLA.\n\nMr. Loomis to Mr. Varilla.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF STATE,\n\nWashington, November 12, 1903.\n\nSIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note of the 11th instant, in which you advise me that the Republic of Panama lass appointed you to fill, near this Government, the post of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, with full powers to negotiate.\n\nYou further ask that this information may be communicated to the President and that he will kindly fix a date at which you may present your letters of credence.\n\nIn reply I have the honor to say that the President will be pleased to receive you for the purpose mentioned to-morrow, Friday, at 9:30 a.m.\n\nIf you will be good enough to call at this Department shortly before the hour mentioned, the Secretary of State will be pleased to accompany you to the White House.\n\nAccept, etc.\n\nFRANCIS B. LOOMIS, Acting Secretary.\n\nREMARKS MADE BY THE MINISTER OF PANAMA.\n\nMR. PRESIDENT: In according to the minister plenipotentiary of the Republic of Panama the honor of presenting to you his letters of credence you admit into the family of nations the weakest and the last born of the republics of the New World.\n\nIt owes its existence to the outburst of the indignant grief which stirred the hearts of the citizens of the Isthmus on beholding the despotic action which sought to forbid their country from fulfilling the destinies vouchsafed to it by Providence.\n\nIn consecrating its right to exist, Mr. President, you put an end to what appeared to be the interminable controversy as to the rival waterways, and you definitely inaugurate the era of the achievement of the Panama Canal.\n\nFrom this time forth the determination of the fate of the canal depends upon two elements alone, now brought face to face, singularly unlike as regards their authority and power, but wholly equal in their common and ardent desire to see at last the accomplishment of the heroic enterprise for piercing the mountain barrier of the Andes.\n\nThe highway from Europe to Asia, following the pathway of the sun, is now to be realized.\n\nThe early attempts to find such a way unexpectedly resulted in the greatest of all historic achievements, the discovery of America. Centuries have since rolled by, but the pathway sought has hitherto remained in the realm of dreams. To-day, Mr. President, in response to your summons, it becomes a reality.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT'S REPLY TO THE REMARKS MADE BY SENOR BUNAU VARILLA ON THE OCCASION OF THE PRESENTATION OF HIS LETTERS OF CREDENCE.\n\nMR. MINISTER: I am much gratified to receive the letters whereby you are accredited to the Government of the United States in the capacity of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the Republic of Panama.\n\nIn accordance with its long-established rule, this Government has taken cognizance of the act of the ancient territory of Panama in reasserting the right of self-control and, seeing in the recent events on the Isthmus an unopposed expression of the will of the people of Panama and the confirmation of their declared independence by the institution of a de facto government, republican in form and spirit, and alike able and resolved to discharge the obligations pertaining to sovereignty, we have entered into relations with the new Republic. It is fitting that we should do so now, as we did nearly a century ago when the Latin peoples of America proclaimed the right of popular government, and it is equally fitting that the United States should, now as then, be the first to stretch out the hand of fellowship and to observe toward the new-born State the rules of equal intercourse that regulate the relations of sovereignties toward one another.\n\nI feel that I express the wish of my countrymen in assuring you, and through you the people of the Republic of Panama, of our earnest hope and desire that stability and prosperity shall attend the new State, and that, in harmony with the United States, it may be the providential instrument of untold benefit to the civilized world through the opening of a highway of universal commerce across its exceptionally favored territory.\n\nFor yourself, Mr. Minister, I wish success in the discharge of the important mission to which you have been called.\n\nNAVY DEPARTMENT,\n\nWashington, November 12, 1903.\n\nSIR: In accordance with the resolution of the House of Representatives of the 9th instant, calling for all correspondence and other official documents relating to the recent revolution on the Isthmus of Panama, I have the honor to transmit herewith all such matter on file in the Navy Department.\n\nVery Respectfully,\n\nWILLIAM H.
